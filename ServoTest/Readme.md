This is just a simple test to make a servo move. This uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU, the Servo.h arduino library, and a continuous rotation servo. It doesnt do anything fun- I just increment the value programmed to the servo in the loop so it changes speed and direction.

Any continuous rotation servo will work from Amazon, etc. I used the 'ROB-09347' from sparkfun.com.

The NodeMCU is powered from the microUSB connector. Connect the voltage form the servor to VIN, GND to any GND pin, and the data pin to D4.
